## Install Log

This is a log of my experience setting up Caffe on Ubuntu 13.04 by following these two sets of instructions:

- http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
- https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Installation-%28rbg%29

Notes:

- Here we use Ubuntu 13.04 instead of 12.04, as assumed by the second link above.
- When starting this installation, I already had Cuda 5.5 installed.
- I had a checkout of caffe at `$HOME/s/caffe`. If your checkout is at a different location, just change any instances of `s/caffe` to the correct path.



## Steps

Try to compile:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ make
    /usr/bin/g++ src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.cc -pthread -fPIC -DNDEBUG -O2 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/local/include -I./src -I./include -I/usr/local/cuda/include -I/opt/intel/mkl/include -c -o build/src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.o
    In file included from src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.cc:4:0:
    ./src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h:9:42: fatal error: google/protobuf/stubs/common.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.
    make: *** [build/src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.o] Error 1

Fails, so install libprotobuf-dev:

    jason [~] $ sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev

Try to compile:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ make
    /usr/bin/g++ src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.cc -pthread -fPIC -DNDEBUG -O2 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/local/include -I./src -I./include -I/usr/local/cuda/include -I/opt/intel/mkl/include -c -o build/src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.o
    
    /usr/bin/g++ src/caffe/layer_factory.cpp -pthread -fPIC -DNDEBUG -O2 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/local/include -I./src -I./include -I/usr/local/cuda/include -I/opt/intel/mkl/include -c -o build/src/caffe/layer_factory.o
    In file included from ./include/caffe/blob.hpp:6:0,
                     from ./include/caffe/layer.hpp:7,
                     from src/caffe/layer_factory.cpp:8:
    ./include/caffe/common.hpp:6:32: fatal error: boost/shared_ptr.hpp: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.
    make: *** [build/src/caffe/layer_factory.o] Error 1

Fails, so install boost:

    jason [~] $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Note: this installed boost 1.49 by default on Ubuntu 13.04.

Try to compile:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ make
    /usr/bin/g++ src/caffe/layer_factory.cpp -pthread -fPIC -DNDEBUG -O2 -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include -I/usr/local/include -I./src -I./include -I/usr/local/cuda/include -I/opt/intel/mkl/include -c -o build/src/caffe/layer_factory.o

    ./include/caffe/common.hpp:12:26: fatal error: glog/logging.h: No such file or directory

Fails, so install google-glog:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ mkdir -p ~/temp/glog
    jason [~/s/caffe] $ cd ~/temp/glog
    jason [~/temp/glog] $ wget 'https://google-glog.googlecode.com/files/glog-0.3.3.tar.gz'
    ...
    jason [~/temp/glog] $ tar xvzf glog-0.3.3.tar.gz
    ...
    jason [~/temp/glog] $ cd glog-0.3.3/
    jason [~/temp/glog/glog-0.3.3] $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/s/caffe/local
    ...
    jason [~/temp/glog/glog-0.3.3] $ make
    ...
    jason [~/temp/glog/glog-0.3.3] $ make install
    ...
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Libraries have been installed in:
       /home/jason/s/caffe/local/lib
    
    If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
    in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
    specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
    flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
       - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
         during execution
       - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
         during linking
       - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
       - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
    
    See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
    more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

    jason [~/temp/opencv/opencv-2.4.8/release] $ sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev

Try to compile:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ make

It works!





## Bonus: build pycaffe

After installing all the prereqs above, this worked the first time for me:

    jason [~/s/caffe] $ make pycaffe

It works!





## MNIST example

Running the MNIST example from http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/mnist.html is straightforward, but that page was missing a step, so I've included a log below:


    jason [~/s/caffe/data] $ ./get_mnist.sh
    Downloading...
    Unzipping...
    Done.

We also need to run `./create_mnist.sh` to create the leveldb files from the `*-ubyte` files we just downloaded:
    
    jason [~/s/caffe/data] $ ./create_mnist.sh
    Creating leveldb...
    ../build/examples/convert_mnist_data.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libglog.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    ../build/examples/convert_mnist_data.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libglog.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    Done.

Oops, this doesn't work because it's not sure where to find `libglog`. We'd better add `$HOME/s/caffe/local/lib` to our `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Let's add the MKL library location as well (this line is for intel64):
    
    jason [~/s/caffe/data] $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/s/caffe/local/lib:$HOME/intel/composerxe/mkl/lib/intel64
    
Now creation of the leveldb files should work:

    jason [~/s/caffe/data] $ ./create_mnist.sh
    Creating leveldb...
    Done.

    jason@kronk [~/s/caffe/data] $ ls -d *leveldb
    mnist-test-leveldb/  mnist-train-leveldb/

Now we can train the net! Note that my binary ended up in `../build/examples/train_net.bin` instead of at `../examples/train_net.bin`:

    jason@kronk [~/s/caffe/data] $ GLOG_logtostderr=1 ../build/examples/train_net.bin lenet_solver.prototxt
